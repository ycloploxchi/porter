The highlight of the episode, however, is Super Hans (Jez's drug-addled friend) who declares that he is giving up crack for good, leading to the most memorable Jez line ever, "Aww, but you love crack. It's your favorite." Hans entrusts Mark with all his crack stash and makes him swear to never return it, even if Hans comes knocking on the door begging for it, or threatens to hit Mark...with a piece of wood. Of course, Hans shows up later with a wooden plank in his hand, uttering only one word, "Crack." Mark, without any hesitation, hands over the crack and slams the door shut. Hilarious.
