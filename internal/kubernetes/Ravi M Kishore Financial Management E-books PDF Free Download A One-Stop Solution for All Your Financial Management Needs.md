## What is Financial Management?
 
Financial management is the process of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling the financial activities of an organization. It involves making decisions about how to raise and allocate funds, how to invest and manage assets, how to measure and report performance, and how to deal with risks and uncertainties. Financial management aims to maximize the value of the organization for its stakeholders, such as shareholders, creditors, employees, customers, and society.

Financial management is important for any organization because it affects its survival, growth, and profitability. Without proper financial management, an organization may face cash flow problems, lose competitive advantage, miss opportunities, or even go bankrupt. On the other hand, effective financial management can help an organization achieve its goals, optimize its resources, enhance its efficiency, and create value for its stakeholders.
