If you are a chess enthusiast who wants to master the endgame, you may have heard of Nalimov tablebases. These are databases of precomputed positions that can tell you the exact outcome of any endgame with up to six pieces on the board. They can help you avoid blunders, find the best moves, and learn from the optimal play of the strongest engines.

However, Nalimov tablebases are not easy to access. They take up a lot of disk space (about 1.2 TB for the 3-4-5-6 piece tablebases) and require special software to use them. Moreover, they are not free to download. You either have to pay for a subscription service or find a torrent that may be illegal or unsafe.
  
Fortunately, there is a way to set up Nalimov tablebases for free and use them online or offline. In this article, we will show you how to do it in a few simple steps.
  
## Step 1: Download the Nalimov Tablebase Generator
  
The first step is to download the Nalimov Tablebase Generator, a program that can create Nalimov tablebases from scratch. You can find it [here](https://github.com/syzygy1/tb). It is an open-source project by Ronald de Man, who also developed the Syzygy tablebases, another popular format of endgame databases.

The Nalimov Tablebase Generator is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. You can choose the version that suits your operating system and download it as a zip file. Then, extract it to a folder of your choice.
  
## Step 2: Run the Nalimov Tablebase Generator
  
The next step is to run the Nalimov Tablebase Generator and start creating the tablebases you want. You can do this by opening a command prompt or terminal window and navigating to the folder where you extracted the program. Then, type the following command:

    tb -g -f nal -t [number of threads] [pieces]

The -g flag tells the program to generate the tablebases, the -f nal flag tells it to use the Nalimov format, and the -t flag tells it how many threads to use for parallel processing. The [pieces] argument is where you specify which tablebases you want to create. For example, if you want to generate all the 3-4-5-6 piece tablebases, you can type:

    tb -g -f nal -t 4 KQRKQ KRKP KQPKQ KRPKR KQPKR KRPPK KRPKB KRPPKB KRPKN KRPPKN KRPKRPP KRPKRPN

This will create all the tablebases with king, queen, rook, pawn, bishop, and knight combinations. You can also specify individual tablebases or use wildcards (\*) to create groups of tablebases. For example, if you only want to generate the 6-piece tablebases with two queens on each side, you can type:

    tb -g -f nal -t 4 KQQKQQ

Or if you want to generate all the 6-piece tablebases with one queen on each side, you can type:

    tb -g -f nal -t 4 KQ*KQ*

The program will show you the progress and status of each tablebase as it creates them. Depending on your computer's speed and memory, this process may take several hours or days to complete.
  
## Step 3: Use the Nalimov Tablebases Online or Offline
  
Once you have generated the Nalimov tablebases you want, you can use them online or offline with various chess programs and websites. Here are some examples:
  
- [Chess.com Analysis Board](https://www.chess.com/analysis): You can upload your Nalimov tablebases to Chess.com and use them on their analysis board. To do this, go to Settings > Analysis Board > Endgame Tablebase and click on 8cf37b1e13
