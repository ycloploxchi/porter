# What is IBM ADCD z/OS and How to Use It?
 
IBM ADCD z/OS is a customized bundle of z/OS and related products that is designed to help users quickly implement a z/OS system for application development. It is not an IBM program product and is not supported as a product. However, it provides a convenient way to test and run applications on a simulated z/OS environment.
 
In this article, we will explain what IBM ADCD z/OS is, what are its benefits, and how to use it for your development needs.

## What is IBM ADCD z/OS?
 
IBM ADCD z/OS stands for Application Development Controlled Distribution for z/OS. It is a collection of z/OS and related products that are pre-configured and ready to use on a simulated z/OS system. The ADCD can run on IBM Z Development and Test Environment (ZD&T), which is a software solution that emulates IBM Z hardware and allows users to create virtual z/OS systems on x86 platforms.
 
The ADCD contains various software components, such as:
 
- z/OS base operating system
- IBM Db2Â® for z/OS
- IBM CICSÂ® Transaction Server for z/OS
- IBM MQ for z/OS
- IBM WebSphereÂ® Application Server for z/OS
- IBM Cloud PakÂ® for Applications
- and many more...

The ADCD is updated periodically to reflect the latest versions and features of the software products. The current version of the ADCD is z/OS V2R5 May Edition of 2022[^5^].
  
## What are the benefits of IBM ADCD z/OS?
 
IBM ADCD z/OS offers several benefits for users who want to develop, test, or run applications on a z/OS system. Some of these benefits are:

- It reduces the cost and time of setting up a z/OS system by providing a pre-configured and ready-to-use environment.
- It enables users to access the latest versions and features of the software products without having to install or upgrade them individually.
- It allows users to experiment with different configurations and scenarios without affecting the production system.
- It supports various development tools and languages, such as Javaâ¢, COBOL, PL/I, C/C++, Python, Node.js, etc.
- It facilitates the integration and deployment of applications across hybrid cloud environments.

## How to use IBM ADCD z/OS?
 
To use IBM ADCD z/OS, you need to have IBM Z Development and Test Environment (ZD&T) installed on your x86 machine. ZD&T provides the emulation layer that enables the ADCD to run on your machine. You can download ZD&T from [here](https://www.ibm.com/products/z-development-test-environment).
 
Once you have ZD&T installed, you need to download the ADCD image files from [here](http://dtsc.dfw.ibm.com/MVSDS/'HTTPD2.ADCD.GLOBAL.SHTML%28A25BREAD%29'). The image files are compressed in ZIP format and contain the virtual disks that store the ADCD software components. You need to extract the image files and place them in a folder on your machine.
 
Next, you need to create a ZD&T configuration file that defines the parameters of your virtual z/OS system, such as CPU type, memory size, network settings, etc. You can use the sample configuration file that is provided with the ADCD image files as a template. You need to modify the configuration file according to your preferences and requirements.

Finally, you need to start your virtual z/OS system by using the ZD&T command line interface or graphical user interface. You can then log in to your virtual z/OS system by using a terminal emulator or a web browser. You can also use various development tools and utilities that are available on your virtual z/OS system or on your host machine.
